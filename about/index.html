                <h2>Office Admin to Coding Queen</h2>
                <h3>My Journey into Tech</h3>
                <p>Throughout my career, I have had the same experience in every job: within months of starting, I would
                    far exceed the expectations of my employers. They would be amazed at how organized I was, or a new,
                    more efficient process I had designed. To them, it was miraculous. To me, it was tech. Finding new
                    tools and technology to improve any task helped me to succeed time and time again. But I thought
                    that was all technology would ever be to me – a tool that I used, not built.</p>

                <p>That perception changed when I joined a remarkable FinTech company. I was surrounded by intelligent
                    and talented engineers who were building incredible products, and I felt a spark ignite within me.
                    When a friend and colleague enrolled in a coding boot camp, I was inspired by her bravery and
                    decided to take the leap myself.</p>

                <p>From the very beginning, I realized that I had found my true calling. Coding tapped into my creative
                    mind and allowed me to channel my passion for problem-solving. I discovered that I possessed a
                    natural aptitude for it and found joy in the process of building tools and applications from
                    scratch.</p>

                <p>My journey to transition from administrative roles to software engineering has been an eye-opening
                    experience. I no longer see technology as just a tool; I am now an active participant in its
                    creation. I have learned the importance of embracing new opportunities and stepping outside of my
                    comfort zone. Not only has embracing this new career path allowed me to develop a new level of
                    technical expertise, but it has also instilled in me a newfound sense of confidence in my own
                    ability to learn and grow and succeed.</p>
